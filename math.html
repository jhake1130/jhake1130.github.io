		<p><strong>Term</strong> a number, variable, or combinations of both <span class="ex">EX</span> 4 |5x</p>
		
		<p><strong>Coefficient</strong> When combining variables and a number to write a term, the number is
		always listed first and called coefficient <span class="ex">EX</span> 2x</p>
		
		<p><strong>Like Terms</strong> always have the same variable, but different numbers
		<span class="ex">EX</span> 2x + 5x <span class="ex">EX</span> 6y - 3y
		<span class="ex">EX</span> 2x and 5y are <strong>not</strong> like terms. Like terms 
		<strong>always</strong> have the same variable and power</p>
		
		<p><strong>Combining Like Terms</strong> is the process of adding and subtracting like terms to simplify
		an expression <span class="ex">EX</span> 5x + 6x = 11x <span class="ex">EX</span> 5x - 2y + 2x | 7x -2y </p>
		
		<p><strong>Substitution</strong> is when a variable is holding a place for an unknown number
		<span class="ex">EX</span> 2x - y - 3z| x is 4, y is -3, z is -1 | 2(8) - -3 - 3(-1) | =14</p>
			<hr>
		
		<center><h2 id="105">1.05</h2></center>
		<p><strong>Distributive Property</strong> is the process of multiplying a term to a sum</p>
		
		<h3>Distributive Property with Multiplication</h3>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 5(m +6) turns into 5m+30</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 3(h -7) turns into 3h -21</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> -9(x-2) turns into 9x+ 18</p>

		<h3>Properties</h3>
		<p><strong>Commutative Property of Addition and Multiplication</strong> numbers can move around and change
		order, they commute <span class="ex">EX</span> 5+2 can be 2+5</p>
		<p><strong>Associative Property of Addition and Multiplication</strong> You move numbers around
		and they are the same <span class="ex">EX</span> 1 + (2+3) is the same as (1+2) + 3 </p>
		<p><strong>Equality</strong> means the same so use the = sign to show that</p>
		<h3>Properties of Equality</h3>
		<p><strong>Reflexive Property</strong> 5=5, is the same thing on both sides</p>
		<p><strong>Symmetric Property</strong> 3= 2y+ 1 or 2+1 =3, symmetry is one side is same as the
		other, basically flipping it</p>
		<p><strong>Transitive Property</strong> If a=b and b=c then a =c, think three parts</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 4+x = x+4 is Commutative</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> a+b = 4 so 4 = a+b is Symmetric</p>
		<h3>True and False Equations</h3>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 10 = 10 is <strong>true</strong>, 5 = 3 is <strong>false</strong></p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 5+ 7 = 3 +9 is <strong>true</strong></p>
		<h3>Examples</h3>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 4 *(x * y) = (4 * x) * y is Associative</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 10 = 10 is Reflexive</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 4 * 10 = 10 * 4 is Commutative</p>

		<p>With <strong>ALL</strong> equations, the goal is to isolate the variable and determine the solution. 
		When doing equations with multiple steps, equations are like scales, you have to keep them balanced
		what you do to one side of an equation you must to do the other</p>
		<strong><p>YOU CAN CHECK BY SUBSITUTING THE NUMBER YOU GET IN THE ORIGINAL EQUATION</p></strong>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> x - 7 = 11, add 7 to both sides so x=11</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 2x + 7 = 15, minus 7 to both sides so 2x=8, then divide both 
		numbers by 2 so x =4</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 5x -6 =19,, add 6 to both sides, 5x =25, then divide both numbers by 5
		to get x=5. </p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 3x - 7 =5, add 7 to both sides, 3x = 12, divide by 3 on both sides
		to get x =4</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 3x + 2 - 6x + 6 = 29, combine like terms to get -3x + 8 = 29, minus 8
		from both sides, -3x = 21, then divide by -3 to both numbers to get x = -7</p>
		<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 2(x + 4) = 10, distribute the 2, 2x + 8 =10, then minus 8 from both sides,
		2x = 2, divide by 2 to both sides, to get x =1</p>
			<hr>
		<center><h2 id="203">2.03</h2></center>
			<h3>Equations with variables on both side</h3>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 3x + 3 = 2x+ 5, -3 from both sides, 3x= 2x+ 2, minus 2x from 3x to get
			x =2
			</p> 
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 2x + 3 = 6x -5, minus the 2x, 3= 4x -5, add the 5 to both sides,
			8= 4x, now divide 4 to both numbers to get x=2</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 8+2(x +3) = 3(x+4), distribute, 8 +2x + 6 = 3x+ 12, then add the 8
			to 6, 2x+ 14 = 3x+12, then minus the 2x from both sides, 14 =x+ 12, then minus the 12 to get 2 =x</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 2x - 6 =2(x-3), distribute, 2x - 6 = 2x -6, minus the 2x, -6 = -6</p>

		<center><h2 id="205">2.05</h2></center>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> Twice a number added to seven equals 23 is a guessing game so
			2n + 7 = 23, n being the number I do not know</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> Find a number, when decreased by 18 is 5 times its opposite, so
			n-18 = 5(-n)</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> The number of malls Virginia is 21 less then half the number of malls
			in NC. So 242 = m/2 -21.</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> John is eleven times as old as his son Marcus, in 12 years, John will
			be three times as old as Marcus, what is Marcus's age now? So make a table
			<table><td>Name</td><td>Age Now</td><td>Age in 12 yrs</td> <tr> <td>Marcus</td><td>x</td><td>x+12</td>
			<tr> <td>John</td><td>11x</td><td>11x + 12</td></table>John's age in 12 years is 11x+ 12
			and three times is 3(x+12) and the dads age in 12 years. So 11x + 12 = 3(x+ 12), then do equation
			to get x =3. So his age now is 3</p>

			<p><span class="ex">EX</span>x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 75, add the x's and the numbers, 3x + 3 =75,
			then you get x =24</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span>The sum of two consecutive even integers is 132, find the integers,
			x+ (x+2) + (x+4) = 132. You skip by 1 because it is even integers, then do the same instructions

			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> When you multiply a fraction by its denominator, the answer is
			the numerator so 3/5 then 3/ 5* 5 <strong>or</strong> 15/5 is now 3 because I put 5 in 15 3 times</p>
			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 4/5x + 2 = 22, times every number by 5, 5/1 * 4/5x + 10 = 110,
			then times 5 into 4 and 1 into 5, and then put 5 into 20 4 times to get 4x + 10 = 110. Then do

			<p><span class="ex">EX</span> 2/3(v+ 8) = -8, to, 3 * 2/3(v+8) = 3*-8, to, 3/1 * 2/3(v+8) = -24

			<p><strong>Venn Diagrams</strong> visual representations of a group of things aka a set</p>
			<p><strong>Set</strong> a collection of numbers or objects, venn diagrams are used to see the

			<p><strong>The numbers in a set are called members or elements of a set</strong></p>
			<p>You can use the <strong>....</strong>symbol showing the set continues in the same pattern</p>
			<p><strong>Empty sets</strong> are sets that are empty or have no members and written like (), or a zero
